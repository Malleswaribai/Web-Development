/* 
 Node: Node is a javascript run time environment . It will run the stand alone javascript code outside the browser. These day node is getting popular for server side coding. 
 To create a node project we need a package.json file which will maintain the versions of node packages. this file will be responcible to download required project to that pirticular project.
 Package: It is a javascript library where there exists pre writtened code which will make the developer life easier. It is like stl in c++ ;

 to set up package.json in the folder , we need to run a command npm init. 
 npm stands for node package manager.
 there are lot of packages on the internet. the most popular one that we use is express.

 to install a package we need to run command npm install package_name. 

 When we run the above command a folder is created node_modules, this folder contains all the package code. this will be downloaded from the internet when we run npm install. 
 
 We need to create a file with name .gitignore , inside this file we need to mention node_modules so that these files won't be tracked by git.
